Credit standards for wholesale electric markets have the opportunity to become a uniformly guiding force under FERC Order 741 thanks to work nearing completion by the Committee of Chief Risk Officers, CCRO.
</p><p>
In case you aren’t aware, most ISOs and RTOs follow individual credit practices through various tariff revisions. Credit decisions and responses are not confined to any one region or market. The risk of a default in one market could seriously weaken a participant and perhaps another market. The potential ripple effects could, in fact, be significant.
</p><p>
Going forward, it’s not going to be that way. Be a part of the solution taking shape in front of the Dec. 14 deadline for ISOs to file at the FERC. Be sure to join the CCRO to help ensure its ISO Standards white paper addresses the risk management and credit issues that you and your organization consider important. Visit CCRO.org and follow the links to sign up for the December 1-2 meetings in Washington, DC.
</p><p>
Given the roles that credit has played in the nation’s recent financial setbacks, it is incumbent on all ISOs, RTOs and the companies that operate in them to improve what the industry can do itself and management inherent risks in response the Order 741. Your feedback can help forge industry best practices in this vital arena.
</p><p>
As a unique, independent, affiliation of credit and energy risk management professionals collaborating in an antitrust-compliant environment, the CCRO, along with inputs from senior staff from ISOs, utilities and power marketers, are achieving uniformity which began with surveys and questionnaires earlier this year. The single standard ready for a final industry review can serve all market players, answer several questions and minimize risks and uncertainty going forward.
